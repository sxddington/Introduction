# You are learning about: Sid
Hello! My name is Sid. I go by he/him pronouns, I am on the Autism spectrum, I have ADHD, and I guess you could say I'm just a silly guy!!!
I am -18, so please don't be weird around me!! It makes me very uncomfortable when people are weird like that.
I might seem outgoing, but I am truly masking a TON of anxiety. So, please dont rush me :(
I have interest in Dandy's World, Murder Drones, ITFT, and harp seals!
My favorite characters across all of my interests are Looey, N, and Clock!
